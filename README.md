Business Insights 360 is a dynamic Power BI data visualization initiative, offering real-time insights tailored to stakeholder needs. The project features five main views—Finance, Sales, Marketing, Supply Chain, and Executive—highlighting crucial metrics and KPIs for informed, data-driven decision-making.

The inadequacy of these reports for informed decision-making led to substantial losses. To address this challenge, AtliQ sought a data analytics team to develop a dynamic Power BI dashboard. This multifunctional tool aims to provide comprehensive insights across departments, including Finance, Sales, Marketing, and Supply Chain.
